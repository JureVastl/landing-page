# landing-page

Project 2 for The Odin Project

I need to create a landing page with a picture of the design for reference on how it should look like and second picture with fonts and colors i should use.

We have a freedom for the design but i want to make basically a clone and just add some copyright fee pictures in the placeholders.

Picture of the desired outcome:
